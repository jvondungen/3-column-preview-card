## My process
I built this 3-column preview using flex display. It came together pretty quickly, but I did not have the figma files so had to estimate sizes. Overall this was a fun practice.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned to estimate my time. It took a bit longer than I expected and I realize that I do need to practice more. Will try to keep up with that.


### Continued development

I'd like to continue practicing creating responsive designs. 


### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me when my button filled the entire width of the card. I got help using `align-self`. I had used this when working with my first grid display, but now know it can be used on flex designs as well.
